Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently gained increasing popularity in both applications and research, including domains such as social networks, knowledge graphs, recommender systems, and bioinformatics. While the theory and math behind GNNs might first seem complicated, the implementation of those models is quite simple and helps in understanding the methodology. Therefore, we will discuss the implementation of basic network layers of a GNN, namely graph convolutions, and attention layers. Finally, we will apply a GNN on a node-level, edge-level, and graph-level tasks.\n",

        "\n",
        "Before starting the discussion of specific neural network operations on graphs, we should consider how to represent a graph. Mathematically, a graph $\\mathcal{G}$ is defined as a tuple of a set of nodes/vertices $V$, and a set of edges/links $E$: $\\mathcal{G}=(V,E)$. Each edge is a pair of two vertices, and represents a connection between them. For instance, let's look at the following graph:\n",
        "\n",
        "<center width=\"100%\" style=\"padding:10px\"><img src=\"https://github.com/phlippe/uvadlc_notebooks/blob/master/docs/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial7/example_graph.svg?raw=1\" width=\"250px\"></center>\n",
        "\n",
        "The vertices are $V=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$, and edges $E=\\{(1,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4)\\}$. Note that for simplicity, we assume the graph to be undirected and hence don't add mirrored pairs like $(2,1)$. In application, vertices and edge can often have specific attributes, and edges can even be directed. The question is how we could represent this diversity in an efficient way for matrix operations. Usually, for the edges, we decide between two variants: an adjacency matrix, or a list of paired vertex indices. \n",
        "\n",
        "The **adjacency matrix** $A$ is a square matrix whose elements indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent, i.e. connected, or not. In the simplest case, $A_{ij}$ is 1 if there is a connection from node $i$ to $j$, and otherwise 0. If we have edge attributes or different categories of edges in a graph, this information can be added to the matrix as well. For an undirected graph, keep in mind that $A$ is a symmetric matrix ($A_{ij}=A_{ji}$). For the example graph above, we have the following adjacency matrix:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
        "    0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n",
        "    1 & 0 & 1 & 1\\\\\n",
        "    0 & 1 & 0 & 1\\\\\n",
        "    0 & 1 & 1 & 0\n",
        "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "While expressing a graph as a list of edges is more efficient in terms of memory and (possibly) computation, using an adjacency matrix is more intuitive and simpler to implement. In our implementations below, we will rely on the adjacency matrix to keep the code simple. However, common libraries use edge lists, which we will discuss later more.\n",
        "Alternatively, we could also use the list of edges to define a sparse adjacency matrix with which we can work as if it was a dense matrix, but allows more memory-efficient operations. PyTorch supports this with the sub-package `torch.sparse` ([documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/sparse.html)) which is however still in a beta-stage (API might change in future)."

        "\n",
        "Graph Convolutional Networks have been introduced by [Kipf et al.](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJU4ayYgl) in 2016 at the University of Amsterdam. He also wrote a great [blog post](https://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks/) about this topic, which is recommended if you want to read about GCNs from a different perspective. GCNs are similar to convolutions in images in the sense that the \"filter\" parameters are typically shared over all locations in the graph. At the same time, GCNs rely on message passing methods, which means that vertices exchange information with the neighbors, and send \"messages\" to each other. Before looking at the math, we can try to visually understand how GCNs work. The first step is that each node creates a feature vector that represents the message it wants to send to all its neighbors. In the second step, the messages are sent to the neighbors, so that a node receives one message per adjacent node. Below we have visualized the two steps for our example graph. \n",
        "\n",
        "<center width=\"100%\" style=\"padding:10px\"><img src=\"https://github.com/phlippe/uvadlc_notebooks/blob/master/docs/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial7/graph_message_passing.svg?raw=1\" width=\"700px\"></center>\n",
        "\n",
        "If we want to formulate that in more mathematical terms, we need to first decide how to combine all the messages a node receives. As the number of messages vary across nodes, we need an operation that works for any number. Hence, the usual way to go is to sum or take the mean. Given the previous features of nodes $H^{(l)}$, the GCN layer is defined as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$H^{(l+1)} = \\sigma\\left(\\hat{D}^{-1/2}\\hat{A}\\hat{D}^{-1/2}H^{(l)}W^{(l)}\\right)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "$W^{(l)}$ is the weight parameters with which we transform the input features into messages ($H^{(l)}W^{(l)}$). To the adjacency matrix $A$ we add the identity matrix so that each node sends its own message also to itself: $\\hat{A}=A+I$. Finally, to take the average instead of summing, we calculate the matrix $\\hat{D}$ which is a diagonal matrix with $D_{ii}$ denoting the number of neighbors node $i$ has. $\\sigma$ represents an arbitrary activation function, and not necessarily the sigmoid (usually a ReLU-based activation function is used in GNNs). \n",
        "\n",
        "When implementing the GCN layer in PyTorch, we can take advantage of the flexible operations on tensors. Instead of defining a matrix $\\hat{D}$, we can simply divide the summed messages by the number of neighbors afterward. Additionally, we replace the weight matrix with a linear layer, which additionally allows us to add a bias. Written as a PyTorch module, the GCN layer is defined as follows:"

However, in a GNN, we would also want to allow feature exchange between nodes beyond its neighbors. This can be achieved by applying multiple GCN layers, which gives us the final layout of a GNN. The GNN can be build up by a sequence of GCN layers and non-linearities such as ReLU. For a visualization, see below (figure credit - [Thomas Kipf, 2016](https://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks/)).\n",

While the simplest option might be using residual connections, the more common approach is to either weigh the self-connections higher or define a separate weight matrix for the self-connections.

This concept can be similarly applied to graphs, one of such is the Graph Attention Network (called GAT, proposed by [Velickovic et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903)). Similarly to the GCN, the graph attention layer creates a message for each node using a linear layer/weight matrix. For the attention part, it uses the message from the node itself as a query, and the messages to average as both keys and values (note that this also includes the message to itself). The score function $f_{attn}$ is implemented as a one-layer MLP which maps the query and key to a single value. The MLP looks as follows (figure credit - [Velickovic et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903)):\n",

        "\n",
        "In some applications, we might have to predict on an edge-level instead of node-level. The most common edge-level task in GNN is link prediction. Link prediction means that given a graph, we want to predict whether there will be/should be an edge between two nodes or not. For example, in a social network, this is used by Facebook and co to propose new friends to you. Again, graph level information can be crucial to perform this task. The output prediction is usually done by performing a similarity metric on the pair of node features, which should be 1 if there should be a link, and otherwise close to 0. To keep the tutorial short, we will not implement this task ourselves. Nevertheless, there are many good resources out there if you are interested in looking closer at this task.\n",

        "\n",
        "Finally, in this part of the tutorial, we will have a closer look at how to apply GNNs to the task of graph classification. The goal is to classify an entire graph instead of single nodes or edges. Therefore, we are also given a dataset of multiple graphs that we need to classify based on some structural graph properties. The most common task for graph classification is molecular property prediction, in which molecules are represented as graphs. Each atom is linked to a node, and edges in the graph are the bonds between atoms. For example, look at the figure below. \n",

        "\n",
        "On the left, we have an arbitrary, small molecule with different atoms, whereas the right part of the image shows the graph representation. The atom types are abstracted as node features (e.g. a one-hot vector), and the different bond types are used as edge features. For simplicity, we will neglect the edge attributes in this tutorial, but you can include by using methods like the [Relational Graph Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06103) that uses a different weight matrix for each edge type.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset we will use below is called the MUTAG dataset. It is a common small benchmark for graph classification algorithms, and contain 188 graphs with 18 nodes and 20 edges on average for each graph. The graph nodes have 7 different labels/atom types, and the binary graph labels represent \"their mutagenic effect on a specific gram negative bacterium\" (the specific meaning of the labels are not too important here). The dataset is part of a large collection of different graph classification datasets, known as the [TUDatasets](https://chrsmrrs.github.io/datasets/), which is directly accessible via `torch_geometric.datasets.TUDataset` ([documentation](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/datasets.html#torch_geometric.datasets.TUDataset)) in PyTorch Geometric.

        "When using a data loader, we encounter a problem with batching $N$ graphs. Each graph in the batch can have a different number of nodes and edges, and hence we would require a lot of padding to obtain a single tensor. Torch geometric uses a different, more efficient approach: we can view the $N$ graphs in a batch as a single large graph with concatenated node and edge list. As there is no edge between the $N$ graphs, running GNN layers on the large graph gives us the same output as running the GNN on each graph separately. Visually, this batching strategy is visualized below (figure credit - PyTorch Geometric team, [tutorial here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1I8a0DfQ3fI7Njc62__mVXUlcAleUclnb?usp=sharing#scrollTo=2owRWKcuoALo)).\n",

The batch indices, stored in `batch`, show that the first 12 nodes belong to the first graph, the next 22 to the second graph, and so on. These indices are important for performing the final prediction. To perform a prediction over a whole graph, we usually perform a pooling operation over all nodes after running the GNN model. In this case, we will use the average pooling. Hence, we need to know which nodes should be included in which average pool. Using this pooling, we can already create our graph network below. Specifically, we re-use our class `GNNModel` from before, and simply add an average pool and single linear layer for the graph prediction task. "

We looked at how a graph can be represented (adjacency matrix or edge list), and discussed the implementation of common graph layers: GCN and GAT. The implementations showed the practical side of the layers, which is often easier than the theory. Finally, we experimented with different tasks, on node-, edge- and graph-level. Overall, we have seen that including graph information in the predictions can be crucial for achieving high performance. There are a lot of applications that benefit from GNNs, and the importance of these networks will likely increase over the next years."
