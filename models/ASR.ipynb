It is much simpler to use Wav2Vec2 without a language model as an end-to-end ASR system and it has been shown that a standalone Wav2Vec2 acoustic model achieves impressive results. For demonstration purposes, we fine-tune the \"base\"-sized [pretrained checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-base) on the rather small [Timit](https://huggingface.co/datasets/timit_asr) dataset that contains just 5h of training data."
