# **Fine-tuning Wav2Vec2 for English ASR with ðŸ¤— Transformers**

Wav2Vec2 is a pretrained model for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and was released in [September 2020](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/wav2vec-20-learning-the-structure-of-speech-from-raw-audio/) by Alexei Baevski, Michael Auli, and Alex Conneau.

Using a novel contrastive pretraining objective, Wav2Vec2 learns powerful speech representations from more than 50.000 hours of unlabeled speech. Similar, to [BERT's masked language modeling](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/), the model learns contextualized speech representations by randomly masking feature vectors before passing them to a transformer network.

![wav2vec2_structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickvonplaten/scientific_images/master/wav2vec2.png)

For the first time, it has been shown that pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on very little labeled speech data achieves competitive results to state-of-the-art ASR systems. Using as little as 10 minutes of labeled data, Wav2Vec2 yields a word error rate (WER) of less than 5% on the clean test set of [LibriSpeech](https://huggingface.co/datasets/librispeech_asr) - *cf.* with Table 9 of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11477.pdf).

In this notebook, we will give an in-detail explanation of how Wav2Vec2's pretrained checkpoints can be fine-tuned on any English ASR dataset. Note that in this notebook, we will fine-tune Wav2Vec2 without making use of a language model. It is much simpler to use Wav2Vec2 without a language model as an end-to-end ASR system and it has been shown that a standalone Wav2Vec2 acoustic model achieves impressive results. For demonstration purposes, we fine-tune the "base"-sized [pretrained checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-base) on the rather small [Timit](https://huggingface.co/datasets/timit_asr) dataset that contains just 5h of training data.

Wav2Vec2 is fine-tuned using Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), which is an algorithm that is used to train neural networks for sequence-to-sequence problems and mainly in Automatic Speech Recognition and handwriting recognition. 

I highly recommend reading the blog post [Sequence Modeling with CTC (2017)](https://distill.pub/2017/ctc/) very well-written blog post by Awni Hannun.

First, let's try to get a good GPU in our colab! With Google Colab's free version it's sadly becoming much harder to get access to a good GPU. With Google Colab Pro, one has a much easier time getting access to a V100 or P100 GPU however.

${}^1$ Timit is usually evaluated using the phoneme error rate (PER), but by far the most common metric in ASR is the word error rate (WER). To keep this notebook as general as possible we decided to evaluate the model using WER.

## Prepare Data, Tokenizer, Feature Extractor

ASR models transcribe speech to text, which means that we both need a feature extractor that processes the speech signal to the model's input format, *e.g.* a feature vector, and a tokenizer that processes the model's output format to text. 

In ðŸ¤— Transformers, the Wav2Vec2 model is thus accompanied by both a tokenizer, called [Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer](https://huggingface.co/transformers/master/model_doc/wav2vec2.html#wav2vec2ctctokenizer), and a feature extractor, called [Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor](https://huggingface.co/transformers/master/model_doc/wav2vec2.html#wav2vec2featureextractor).

Let's start by creating the tokenizer responsible for decoding the model's predictions.

### Create Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer

The [pretrained Wav2Vec2 checkpoint]( ) maps the speech signal to a sequence of context representations as illustrated in the figure above. A fine-tuned Wav2Vec2 checkpoint needs to map this sequence of context representations to its corresponding transcription so that a linear layer has to be added on top of the transformer block (shown in yellow). This linear layer is used to classifies each context representation to a token class analogous how, *e.g.*, after pretraining a linear layer is added on top of BERT's embeddings for further classification - *cf.* with *"BERT"* section of this [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/warm-starting-encoder-decoder).

The output size of this layer corresponds to the number of tokens in the vocabulary, which does **not** depend on Wav2Vec2's pretraining task, but only on the labeled dataset used for fine-tuning. So in the first step, we will take a look at Timit and define a vocabulary based on the dataset's transcriptions.

Let's start by loading the dataset and taking a look at its structure.
"""

from datasets import load_dataset, load_metric

timit = load_dataset("timit_asr")

timit

"""Many ASR datasets only provide the target text, `'text'` for each audio `'audio'` and file `'file'`. Timit actually provides much more information about each audio file, such as the `'phonetic_detail'`, etc., which is why many researchers choose to evaluate their models on phoneme classification instead of speech recognition when working with Timit. However, we want to keep the notebook as general as possible, so that we will only consider the transcribed text for fine-tuning.


"""

timit = timit.remove_columns(["phonetic_detail", "word_detail", "dialect_region", "id", "sentence_type", "speaker_id"])

"""Let's write a short function to display some random samples of the dataset and run it a couple of times to get a feeling for the transcriptions."""

"""Alright! The transcriptions look very clean and the language seems to correspond more to written text than dialogue. This makes sense taking into account that [Timit](https://huggingface.co/datasets/timit_asr) is a read speech corpus.

We can see that the transcriptions contain some special characters, such as `,.?!;:`. Without a language model, it is much harder to classify speech chunks to such special characters because they don't really correspond to a characteristic sound unit. *E.g.*, the letter `"s"` has a more or less clear sound, whereas the special character `"."` does not.
Also in order to understand the meaning of a speech signal, it is usually not necessary to include special characters in the transcription.

In addition, we normalize the text to only have lower case letters and append a word separator token at the end.

- The model has to learn to predict when a word finished or else the model prediction would always be a sequence of chars which would make it impossible to separate words from each other.
- In English, we need to keep the `'` character to differentiate between words, *e.g.*, `"it's"` and `"its"` which have very different meanings.

To make it clearer that `" "` has its own token class, we give it a more visible character `|`. In addition, we also add an "unknown" token so that the model can later deal with characters not encountered in Timit's training set. 

Finally, we also add a padding token that corresponds to CTC's "*blank token*". The "blank token" is a core component of the CTC algorithm. For more information, please take a look at the "Alignment" section [here](https://distill.pub/2017/ctc/).

### Create Wav2Vec2 Feature Extractor

Speech is a continuous signal and to be treated by computers, it first has to be discretized, which is usually called **sampling**. The sampling rate hereby plays an important role in that it defines how many data points of the speech signal are measured per second. Therefore, sampling with a higher sampling rate results in a better approximation of the *real* speech signal but also necessitates more values per second.

A pretrained checkpoint expects its input data to have been sampled more or less from the same distribution as the data it was trained on. The same speech signals sampled at two different rates have a very different distribution, *e.g.*, doubling the sampling rate results in data points being twice as long. Thus, 
before fine-tuning a pretrained checkpoint of an ASR model, it is crucial to verify that the sampling rate of the data that was used to pretrain the model matches the sampling rate of the dataset used to fine-tune the model.

Wav2Vec2 was pretrained on the audio data of [LibriSpeech](https://huggingface.co/datasets/librispeech_asr) and LibriVox which both were sampling with 16kHz. Our fine-tuning dataset, [Timit](hhtps://huggingface.co/datasets/timit_asr), was luckily also sampled with 16kHz. If the fine-tuning dataset would have been sampled with a rate lower or higher than 16kHz, we first would have had to up or downsample the speech signal to match the sampling rate of the data used for pretraining.

A Wav2Vec2 feature extractor object requires the following parameters to be instantiated:

- `feature_size`: Speech models take a sequence of feature vectors as an input. While the length of this sequence obviously varies, the feature size should not. In the case of Wav2Vec2, the feature size is 1 because the model was trained on the raw speech signal ${}^2$.
- `sampling_rate`: The sampling rate at which the model is trained on.
- `padding_value`: For batched inference, shorter inputs need to be padded with a specific value
- `do_normalize`: Whether the input should be *zero-mean-unit-variance* normalized or not. Usually, speech models perform better when normalizing the input
- `return_attention_mask`: Whether the model should make use of an `attention_mask` for batched inference. In general, models should **always** make use of the `attention_mask` to mask padded tokens. However, due to a very specific design choice of `Wav2Vec2`'s "base" checkpoint, better results are achieved when using no `attention_mask`. This is **not** recommended for other speech models. For more information, one can take a look at [this](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/issues/3227) issue. **Important** If you want to use this notebook to fine-tune [large-lv60](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-lv60), this parameter should be set to `True`.
"""

from transformers import Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor

feature_extractor = Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor(feature_size=1, sampling_rate=16000, padding_value=0.0, do_normalize=True, return_attention_mask=False)

"""Great, Wav2Vec2's feature extraction pipeline is thereby fully defined!

To make the usage of Wav2Vec2 as user-friendly as possible, the feature extractor and tokenizer are *wrapped* into a single `Wav2Vec2Processor` class so that one only needs a `model` and `processor` object.
"""

processor = Wav2Vec2Processor(feature_extractor=feature_extractor, tokenizer=tokenizer)

"""Next, we can prepare the dataset.

### Preprocess Data

So far, we have not looked at the actual values of the speech signal but just the transcription. In addition to `'text'`, our datasets include two more column names `'file'` and `'audio'`. `'file'` states the absolute path of the audio file. Let's take a look.
"""

timit["train"][0]["file"]

"""`Wav2Vec2` expects the input in the format of a 1-dimensional array of 16 kHz. This means that the audio file has to be loaded and resampled.

print("Sampling rate:", timit["train"][rand_int]["audio"]["sampling_rate"])

"""Good! Everything looks fine - the data is a 1-dimensional array, the sampling rate always corresponds to 16kHz, and the target text is normalized.

Finally, we can process the dataset to the format expected by the model for training. We will make use of the `map(...)` function.

First, we load and resample the audio data, simply by calling `batch["audio"]`.
Second, we extract the `input_values` from the loaded audio file. In our case, the `Wav2Vec2Processor` only normalizes the data. For other speech models, however, this step can include more complex feature extraction, such as [Log-Mel feature extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum).
Third, we encode the transcriptions to label ids.

**Note**: This mapping function is a good example of how the `Wav2Vec2Processor` class should be used. In "normal" context, calling `processor(...)` is redirected to `Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor`'s call method.

## Training & Evaluation

The data is processed so that we are ready to start setting up the training pipeline. We will make use of ðŸ¤—'s [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/transformers/master/main_classes/trainer.html?highlight=trainer) for which we essentially need to do the following:

- Define a data collator. In contrast to most NLP models, Wav2Vec2 has a much larger input length than output length. *E.g.*, a sample of input length 50000 has an output length of no more than 100. Given the large input sizes, it is much more efficient to pad the training batches dynamically meaning that all training samples should only be padded to the longest sample in their batch and not the overall longest sample. Therefore, fine-tuning Wav2Vec2 requires a special padding data collator, which we will define below

- Evaluation metric. During training, the model should be evaluated on the word error rate. We should define a `compute_metrics` function accordingly

- Load a pretrained checkpoint. We need to load a pretrained checkpoint and configure it correctly for training.

- Define the training configuration.

After having fine-tuned the model, we will correctly evaluate it on the test data and verify that it has indeed learned to correctly transcribe speech.

### Set-up Trainer

Let's start by defining the data collator. The code for the data collator was copied from [this example](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/9a06b6b11bdfc42eea08fa91d0c737d1863c99e3/examples/research_projects/wav2vec2/run_asr.py#L81).

Without going into too many details, in contrast to the common data collators, this data collator treats the `input_values` and `labels` differently and thus applies to separate padding functions on them (again making use of Wav2Vec2's context manager). This is necessary because in speech input and output are of different modalities meaning that they should not be treated by the same padding function.
Analogous to the common data collators, the padding tokens in the labels with `-100` so that those tokens are **not** taken into account when computing the loss.

${}^1$ To allow models to become independent of the speaker rate, in CTC, consecutive tokens that are identical are simply grouped as a single token. However, the encoded labels should not be grouped when decoding since they don't correspond to the predicted tokens of the model, which is why the `group_tokens=False` parameter has to be passed. If we wouldn't pass this parameter a word like `"hello"` would incorrectly be encoded, and decoded as `"helo"`.

${}^2$ The blank token allows the model to predict a word, such as `"hello"` by forcing it to insert the blank token between the two l's. A CTC-conform prediction of `"hello"` of our model would be `[PAD] [PAD] "h" "e" "e" "l" "l" [PAD] "l" "o" "o" [PAD]`.

### Training

Training will take between 90 and 270 minutes depending on the GPU allocated to this notebook. While the trained model yields satisfying results on *Timit*'s test data, it is by no means an optimally fine-tuned model. The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate how Wav2Vec2's [base](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-base), [large](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large), and [large-lv60](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-lv60) checkpoints can be fine-tuned on any English dataset.

In case you want to use this google colab to fine-tune your model, you should make sure that your training doesn't stop due to inactivity. A simple hack to prevent this is to paste the following code into the console of this tab (*right mouse click -> inspect -> Console tab and insert code*).

```javascript
function ConnectButton(){
    console.log("Connect pushed"); 
    document.querySelector("#top-toolbar > colab-connect-button").shadowRoot.querySelector("#connect").click() 
}
setInterval(ConnectButton,60000);
```

Depending on what GPU was allocated to your google colab it might be possible that you are seeing an `"out-of-memory"` error here. In this case, it's probably best to reduce `per_device_train_batch_size` to 16 or even less and eventually make use of [`gradient_accumulation`](https://huggingface.co/transformers/master/main_classes/trainer.html#trainingarguments).

"""The output should make it a bit clearer how CTC works in practice. The model is to some extent invariant to speaking rate since it has learned to either just repeat the same token in case the speech chunk to be classified still corresponds to the same token. This makes CTC a very powerful algorithm for speech recognition since the speech file's transcription is often very much independent of its length.

I again advise the reader to take a look at [this](https://distill.pub/2017/ctc) very nice blog post to better understand CTC.
