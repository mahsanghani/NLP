# Prompt
# A neutron star is the collapsed core of a massive supergiant star, which had a total mass of between 10 and 25 solar masses, possibly more if the star was especially metal-rich.[1] Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stellar objects, excluding black holes and hypothetical white holes, quark stars, and strange stars.[2] Neutron stars have a radius on the order of 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) and a mass of about 1.4 solar masses.[3] They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star, combined with gravitational collapse, that compresses the core past white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei.

# Tl;dr
# Sample response
# Neutron stars are the collapsed cores of massive supergiant stars, with a radius of around 10 kilometres and a mass of 1.4 solar masses. They are formed from the supernova explosion of a massive star combined with gravitational collapse, compressing the core beyond white dwarf star density.
