        "## About this demo\n",
        "Meta recently announced [Purple LLaMA](https://ai.meta.com/blog/purple-llama-open-trust-safety-generative-ai/), an umbrella project featuring open trust and safety tools as well as evaluations for enabling developers to responsibly deploy Generative AI models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Llama Guard is a new open source model developed by Meta to enable chat moderation between users and the conversational chat models that they are querying. It is 7 billion parameter model that can be used as classifier for input/output filtering for LLMs. See this [model card](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/LlamaGuard-7b) on HuggingFace for more details on Llama Guard and its capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "At Databricks/MosaicML, we believe that developing guardrails, tools, and systems are an essential component in enabling enterprises to adopt generative AI responsibly. As a result, we've spun up a demo Llama Guard endpoint for the open source community to use to play around with the Llama Guard model. We believe that model safety and implementing guardrails are an essential part of productionizing inference deployments; as a result, we are releasing this endpoint *with no need for authorization* at the public URL `https://models.hosted-on.mosaicml.hosting/llamaguard-7b/v2/chat` that will be available for everyone to try for a limited amount of time. Note that this endpoint has prompt templating built-in so don't worry too much about how to prompt the model! Later in this notebook, we cover how to define a custom taxonomy that you can configure.\n",
        "\n",
        "The docs for this endpoint are the same as those for the [Databricks Foundation Model API](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/foundation-models/api-reference.html). Note that this specific endpoint is strictly for demo purposes so please use it fairly.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this demo, we show how to:\n",
        "1. Interact with Llama Guard for prompt and response filtering\n",
        "2. Configure a custom Llama Guard taxonomy\n",
        "3. Integrate Llama Guard with a chat model inside of an end-to-end safety pipeline"
